# Clipset Project Specification

## Concept
Private, self-hostable video sharing platform for small communities. A cross between YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and a subreddit community - without file size limits or compression.

## Platform Philosophy
Clipset is a **community-first social video platform**, not a file storage service. The focus is on:
- **Community feed**: Home page shows all videos from all users (like Reddit/Instagram)
- **User profiles**: Instagram-style profiles showing each user's uploaded videos
- **Social discovery**: Browse by user, search videos, filter by category
- **Small community scale**: Optimized for friends, family, or small groups (not thousands of users)

## Problem & Solution
Social media platforms compress videos or impose file size limits. Clipset provides a self-hostable alternative deployable via Docker with configurable storage (external drives supported).

## Access Model
- Cloudflare Tunnel for secure external access
- Invitation-only registration via admin-generated email-linked tokens
- Role-based permissions (admin/user)

## Recent Architectural Changes (Phase 5)

### From Personal Dashboard → Community Feed
**Before:** Users logged in to see their own stats, recent uploads, and a separate "Videos" page to browse community content.

**After:** Users land on a community-first home feed showing all videos from all users, sorted by newest or most viewed. Personal stats moved to "My Profile" dialog.

**Impact:**
- More engaging landing experience
- Immediate content discovery
- Aligns with social platform philosophy
- Reduced navigation depth (one less click to see content)

### From Static Profile → Instagram-Style Profiles
**Before:** `/profile` showed own account info and quota in a static page.

**After:** `/profile/:username` shows any user's profile with their uploaded videos. Own profile has special "My Profile" button for accessing quota/account info.

**Impact:**
- Social discovery via user profiles
- Shareable profile URLs
- Consistent UX whether viewing own or others' profiles
- Encourages community interaction

### Navigation Simplification (In Progress)
**Before:** Dashboard | Videos | Upload | Profile | Admin

**After:** Home | Upload | Profile | Admin

**Impact:**
- Clearer branding ("Home" vs "Dashboard")
- Removed redundant "Videos" link (home page IS the videos)
- Streamlined navigation bar
